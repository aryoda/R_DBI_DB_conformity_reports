# TODO list

## Open

- Create RMarkdown report for summarized and detailled results and plots (comparing all tested databases)
- Refactor code to allow reuse
- Dockerize?
- Improve `DBItest` (annotate test cases with description, functions under test, link to test code,
  annotate each expectation...)
- fix or minimize transaction testing problem (e. g. via skip until the bug is fixed in `odbc`)
- log version numbers of R, odbc and DBItest
- store historical results to show a time series of test results
